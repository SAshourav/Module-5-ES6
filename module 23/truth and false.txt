The if condition will false by default for this conditions 

1. 0
2. ''
3. undefined
4. null 
5. NaN 

except this other things depends on the condition you set and the validation of that condition. 
Also you will have the value true if you give any string inside the () without any condition. 

like ,
name = "Ahmed";
if(name){
    consol.log("true");
}else{
    consol.log("false");
}

this will print true as there is no condition only string
